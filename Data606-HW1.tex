\subsection{Introduction to Data}\label{introduction-to-data}}

1.a. The rows are named a \emph{case} or \emph{observational unit}. 1.b.
Apparently, 1691 participants. 1.c. Variables: \emph{sex}. categorical,
nominal. \emph{age}. numerical, discrete. \emph{marital}. categorial,
nominal. \emph{grossIncome}. categorical,ordinal. \emph{smoke}.
categorical, nominal. \emph{amtWeekends}. numerical, discrete. (I think
it can be averaged and summarized) \emph{amtWeekdays}. numerical,
discrete.

\item
  Population is all children between 5 and 15 years old. The sample is
  160 children between those ages.
\item
  The researchers conducted an experiment in which they have no way of
  verifying the answers received. Their goal was to study the
  relationship between honesty, age and self-control but they gave
  themselves little control on how to measure that relationship.
  Granted, you could assume the number of white answers to average 50\%
  and consider any deviation from it to be cheating. This does not
  really guarantee accuracy. I don't believe a causal relationship can
  be established. In terms of generalization, we don't know the
  composition of the sample and if it really represents the population.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{(\alph{enumi})}
\tightlist
\item
  No.~Correlation does not imply causality. To establish causality, we
  would need to perform an experiment with a random sample and not only
  with voluntary supplied data.
\end{enumerate}

(b)Again, a correlation does not imply causality. At most, we can
establish that there is correlation between sleep disorders and bullying
not that one causes the other. There could be one or more variables that
cause these two issues and cannot be determined by the data collected.

\hypertarget{exercise-and-mental-health}{%
\subsubsection{Exercise and mental
health}\label{exercise-and-mental-health}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{(\alph{enumi})}
\tightlist
\item
  Blocked randomized controlled experiment
\item
  Treatment group: the participants who were instructed to exercise.
  Control group: participants who were instructed not to exercise.
\item
  Yes, age is the blocking variable.
\item
  No.~
\item
  The experiment design appears to be correct. The way the experiment is
  designed will only allow us to determine a causal relationship between
  exercise and mental health moving forward, as we do not know the
  exercise habits of the participants before the experiment.
\item
  Yes, I believe the sample should take into consideration exercise
  habits before the experiment and randomly distribute the individuals
  into treatment and control group to properly measure the effects of
  exercise(or lack thereof) on mental health not only on age groups but
  also based on prior exercising habits.
\end{enumerate}
